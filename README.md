## Question-1

You are given two distinct lists `l1` and `l2` of size m and n, their items are not consecutive. Write a `func()` function with two parameters, to find the intersection item between them.

```python
l1 = [3, 2, 4, 5, 1] 
l2 = [7, 4, 5, 2]
func(l1, l2)

output:
[2, 4, 5]
```
## Question-3

You are given two lists `l1` and `l2` that represent two positive integers each. Each digit of the numbers is stored in reverse order, and each item represents one digit. Write a `add()` function to add the two numbers and return the sum as an inverted list.

```python
l1 = [2, 4, 3]
l2 = [5, 6, 4]
add(l1, l2)

output:
[7, 0, 8]
```
